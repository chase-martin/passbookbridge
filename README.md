Simple Passbook webservice bridge
Passbook overlay is detected by polling for a pause in JavaScript. Scrolling also causes a pause in JS so 'touchmove' events are captured while polling. RequestAnimationFrame is used because it is tied to the kind of throttling we are looking for. Animations are always paused when not visible. Other JavaScript pause checking such as setInterval may not be forward compatible. RequestAnimationFrame is more resource intensive than setInterval, but this could be mitigated by restraining the RAF to a small portion of the screen. If RAF isn't needed elsewhere, this might be a better solution for future projects, or for limited emulation of Chrome's pagevisibility api.

The relevant code is in js/passbridge.js for passbook overlay detection and general page animations/transitions, and omniture.js for omniture tracking. Omnititure.js is provided to allow the back-end team to add omniture vars in the html of each page if necessary. Omniture requires that it's dependencies be prepended to it in omniture_compressed.js. Files are concatenated and compressed with closure compiler. Passbridge.js has no dependencies, but expects omniture.js to be used.
